# Schemes
- You can use [[Mechanics and Rules/Downtime\|Downtime]] to progress a goal, objective, or long term plan of your character

# Defining a Scheme
- Define what you are trying to accomplish
	- Example:
		- Change class
		- Create an organization
		- Fulfill an aspect of character backstory/motivation
- Define discrete Scheme Steps to accomplish scheme
	- Work with DM to decide how to break up scheme into steps

# Scheme Step Roll
- DC 18 of relevant skill associated with Scheme Step
- Modifiers will be applied based on context of Scheme Step
	- If you have relevant assets, skills, or resources that would help accomplish the Scheme Step, a positive modifier can be applied
	- If you there are forces actively disrupting your scheme, a negative modifier can be applied
- Success:
	- Progresses Scheme Step
- Failure
	- Does not progress Scheme Step
	- You can try again as your next downtime activity
	- When you next attempt this Scheme Step, lower the DC of the INT check by 1 (cumulative)
