[[Lore/Ages of Urda\|Ages of Urda]]

Dates:
#### TLDR
- The Age of Iron and Bone
- Mortal races begin populating [[Locations/Urda\|Urda]]
- Fragmented polities and civilizations populate the land
- For much of the Second Age, the monsters and threats of [[Locations/Urda\|Urda]] are significantly more powerful than the mortal races
- Material culture and technology are slow to progress and defined by extraction/manipulation of basic materials (stone, wood, iron, bronze)
- Magic is the great disruptor and spurs the greatest societal developments.
	- Uneven knowledge and distribution of magic across ancestries and space
		- Some, such as early [[Ancestries/Humans\|Humans]] have no innate capacity or connection to magic and struggle to carve out the most basic of societal structures into the unforgiving flesh of Urda
