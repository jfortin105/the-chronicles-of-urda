# Description
- Ancient citadel in the plains of [[Locations/Old Lystria\|Old Lystria]]
- "Long ago, a mighty enclave of warriors lived inside the Lost Citadel. They worshipped bulls in ever-bloodier, cultish rituals that culminated in their leader, Minoros, transforming into the Scarlet Minotaur. This immortal avatar of rage slaughtered the warriors in a single night of mayhem. They say that the battle spoils and treasures of the warriors still fills those halls, which has lured adventurers across the ages into those dank halls... but few have returned. Those that have speak of a beast that does not tire, does not hunger, and does not feel pain."
